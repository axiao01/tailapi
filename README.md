# TailAPI

## Vision
TailAPI helps developers and QA teams capture API calls from real browser sessions and transform them into Postman test collections with intelligent variable extraction, flow visualization, and automated documentation.

---

## Key Features

### 1. API Recorder (Browser Extension or Proxy)
- Records HTTP(S) requests from browser sessions
- Captures method, URL, headers, body, response
- Filters out non-essential endpoints
- Optionally groups by session or user actions

### 2. Variable Extraction and Suggestion Engine
- Detects patterns such as tokens, IDs, timestamps
- Suggests variables for substitution in captured APIs
- Allows editing/approval of suggested variables

### 3. API Collection Builder
- UI to view/manage API requests
- Group into collections and folders
- Request editing support (headers, body, etc.)
- Export to Postman v2.1 JSON

### 4. Flowchart & API Dependency Mapping
- Graph view of captured API sequence
- Suggests logical dependencies between APIs
- User can modify API chaining visually
- Based on usage of prior response values in later calls

### 5. Postman Exporter
- Generates Postman collection JSON file
- Uses variables and dependency order
- Compatible with Postman import/export

### 6. Documentation Generator
- Creates markdown or HTML documentation
- Includes:
  - API name and URL
  - Request method and body
  - Parameters and headers
  - Response examples
  - Variables and dependencies

## Target Users
- Developers
- QA Engineers
- DevOps Engineers
- API Testers

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React (w/ TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand or Redux
- React Flow or D3.js
- CodeMirror/Monaco Editor

### Backend
- Node.js + Express (TypeScript)
- Lightweight storage (JSON or SQLite initially)

### Extension
- Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)
- Uses `chrome.webRequest` API to capture network traffic

---

## Development Plan

### Week 1 – Setup & Capture
- React app + Tailwind
- Express server (TypeScript)
- Chrome extension: capture API traffic

### Week 2 – Variable & Request Manager
- Suggest and replace dynamic values
- UI to edit and group requests
- Initial Postman collection creation logic

### Week 3 – Flowchart + Dependencies
- Visualize API calls
- Suggest dependencies based on response linkage
- User editing of call order

### Week 4 – Documentation + Export
- Markdown/HTML doc generation
- Export flowchart + requests to Postman JSON
- Refactor and polish UX/UI

### Week 5 – Testing & Launch
- Validate with real apps (GitHub, etc.)
- Add edge-case handling
- Prepare MVP release or share for feedback

---

## Future Features
- GraphQL/WebSocket support
- Cloud sync + user accounts
- Integration with Newman CLI
- AI-assisted flow documentation
