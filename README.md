# TailAPI

## Vision

TailAPI helps developers and QA teams capture API calls from real browser or app sessions through a local proxy server and transform them into Postman test collections with intelligent variable extraction, flow visualization, and automated documentation.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Proxy-Based API Capture

- Operates as a local proxy server
- Intercepts HTTP and HTTPS traffic (with self-signed cert)
- Captures method, URL, headers, body, response
- Filters out non-essential or third-party calls
- Groups captured calls by session

### 2. Variable Extraction and Suggestion Engine

- Detects patterns such as tokens, IDs, timestamps
- Suggests variables for substitution in captured APIs
- Allows editing/approval of suggested variables

### 3. API Collection Builder

- UI to view/manage captured requests
- Group into collections and folders
- Edit captured requests (headers, body, etc.)
- Export to Postman v2.1 JSON

### 4. Flowchart & API Dependency Mapping

- Visual graph view of captured API sequences
- Auto-suggests dependencies based on variable usage
- User can modify and annotate the flow

### 5. Postman Exporter

- Generates Postman collection JSON file
- Uses variables and dependency order
- Compatible with Postman import/export

### 6. Documentation Generator

- Creates markdown or HTML documentation
- Includes:
  - API name and URL
  - Request method and body
  - Parameters and headers
  - Response examples
  - Variables and dependencies

## Target Users

- Developers
- QA Engineers
- DevOps Engineers
- API Testers

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React (w/ TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand or Redux
- React Flow for dependency graph
- CodeMirror/Monaco for request editing

### Backend

- Node.js + Express (TypeScript)
- JSON or SQLite storage for MVP

### Proxy

- `http-mitm-proxy` (Node.js MITM proxy)
  - Handles HTTP/HTTPS traffic
  - Self-signed cert injection
- Optionally explore `mitmproxy` (Python) if needed

---

## Development Plan

### Week 1 – Setup & Proxy Capture

- Implement proxy server using `http-mitm-proxy`
- TLS interception with root cert generation
- Log full request and response details
- Store sessions in JSON or SQLite

### Week 2 – Variable & Request Manager

- Analyze and suggest variables (ID, token, timestamp)
- Create UI to review/edit captured requests
- Allow organizing into collections

### Week 3 – Flowchart & Dependencies

- Visualize API call flow with React Flow
- Suggest dependencies based on variable usage across calls
- Let users edit relationships and sequence

### Week 4 – Postman Export + Docs

- Generate Postman v2.1 collections from captured flow
- Build markdown/HTML doc generator
- Add formatting and response examples

### Week 5 – Testing & UX Polish

- Test with real apps and traffic
- Handle proxy edge cases (timeouts, large payloads)
- Finalize MVP with a clean UI and export options

---

## Future Features

- GraphQL and WebSocket support
- User accounts and cloud sync
- CLI runner integration (e.g. Newman)
- AI-based flow and test suggestion
